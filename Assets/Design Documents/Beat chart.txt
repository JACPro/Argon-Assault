1. Our researchers say this planet is rich in [precious metal]. It's heavily guarded, but they don't know you're here. Have a look around and see if you can find a [precious metal] deposit. (1/10)
2. Look, a scout! Shoot it down before it can warn the [aliens] we're here! (3/10)
3. Bad news! The scout sent out a distress beacon just before it went down. They know you're here. Prepare yourself; there's an assault squad headed your way! (5/10)
4. Nice work! That should hold them for a little while, but it won't be long before they realise you're still alive. You need to locate that [precious metal] ASAP before the reinforcements arrive. (1/10)
5. That should be enough; now you you just need to bring it back to headquarters. The [aliens] won't make it easy. It looks like the first wave is coming in fast! (8/10)
6. Nice shooting, but they're not giving up! More ships showing on the radar! (9/10)
7. What incredible flying! I hope you have another miracle up your sleeve, because the [aliens] have amassed a swarm of battleships to head you off! Get past these ones and you'll have a clear exit off this planet. (10/10)
